# node-api
I created node-express api with crud functionality.I used mongodb for my database.
It uses GET method to get all the json data from mongodb to the specific route.example localhost:4000/posts.
now to access and use json data into frontend ,i used fetch api.
I only made get,post and delete methods in the javascript file .you can access the frontend side in the folder ./frontend-api .it conatins two files index.html and main.js
yet to complete patch method here
